"""The Snapwell module, a wellpath optimization module.

   This module provides functionality for reading and writing wellpaths in the
   RMS format, as well as optimizing the vertical position of these wellpaths
   provided an Eclipse restart file (UNRST) and a grid file ((E)GRID).

   If one wants to use the snapping feature, a snapconfig file is needed.  This
   file specifies the location of a GRID file, a RESTART file, optionally an
   INIT file, if the PERMX keyword is wanted.  Then follows the wellpath files
   and the date (in the UNRST) wanted.

   See README.md for more information and usage information.

   There is a binary in /project/res/bin/snapwell for reading the config file
   and applying the snapping algorithm.

   This module exposes the WellPath class, the SnapConfig class as well as the
   snap algorithm (in snapecl).
